# html-css-javascript
In Today's technological landscape, especially in the world of Web Development, Frameworks such as Angular and React do most of the work for us. It is true that they greatly reduce our efforts in creating a quality Web Application. They create wrappers for all the basic operations and hence reduce the need to go below certain levels. This lifestyle might be good enough for a Web Developer or even a Senior Developer. But as an Aspiring Leader, I believe that it is a good idea to often revisit the fundamentals of Web Development and understand & experiment with the newer available tools and options. A good Leader always makes sure that the basics are right. So this is my attempt to revisit the building blocks - HTML,CSS & Javascript.
